            <p>Hey there! I'm Yahya but I've been known for years now as Yakuza. I'm a software engineering student on a mission. I'm all about diving headfirst into my studies, fueled by this crazy love for everything programming. Every day, I'm all in on getting better, tackling the tough stuff and figuring out the ins and outs of software development. It's a wild ride, but I'm here for it, ready to push myself and rewrite what's possible. Let's do this!</p>

            <h2>Interests:</h2>
            <p>In my world, creativity knows no bounds.It's a fusion of design, coding, drawing, and storytelling. With each project, I embark on a journey of self-expression and exploration. My passion for design fuels my love for crafting visually stunning creations, while my coding skills bring my ideas to life, adding functionality and depth. Drawing is my sanctuary, where I find solace and inspiration, allowing me to translate my thoughts and emotions onto the canvas. Training is not just a routine but a commitment to growth, pushing myself to continually learn and evolve. And through content creation, I weave together all my interests, sharing my experiences and insights with the world. This is not just a hobbyâ€”it's who I am, a creator at heart, shaping my world one idea at a time.</p>
